1. Firstly we need to define our service definition in a .proto extension file. We need to add grpc specific and protobuff dependencies in maven to create a grpc service.
2. When the project is building the service that we defined in .proto, the protobuff compiler will create the stub classes as well as other important classes to work on.
3. Always a base class will be created by protobuff compiler can be used to implement our service.
4. The service needs to be annotated with @Grpcservice.
5. To test the created service we can test by sending request from postman. From version 9.7.1 postman supports to send gRPC requests.
6. The best practise is to declare each service in a separate .proto files because the classs files will be created separately for each service.
